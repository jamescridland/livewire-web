*This is an archived version, the current version is [here](/podcast-trackers-by-episode-share/).*

Now that we have a good idea of [which podcast hosts are producing new podcast episodes](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share),
let's turn our attention to third-party podcast analytics services.

These services are typically provided by a company that is not the podcast host, but can provide tracking and analytics 
by being specified as the underlying media file url, which then redirects back to the host.  Sometimes, these services
are implemented as custom prefixes (taking the original media url and adding a prefix to it), but not always.

By intercepting every episode media file request, these analytics services can provide a view that is potentially larger than
what the underlying podcast host analytics can provide.

Podtrac, one of the most popular services, released some 
[interesting data about their US download figures for September 2021](https://podnews.net/article/podtrac-us-downloads-and-users-sep21).

But how representative of the entire podcast world is this data?  How many podcasters use services like these?

---

We already did the work of analyzing _every single new podcast episode published_ (about 1.6 million in February 2022), 
[identifying which podcast hosting company it belongs to](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share).

We used the actual media file url (past any tracking redirects) to identify the host
instead of the feed url domain, which can often undercount hosts that offer custom domains.

Let's now take a look at the tracking services themselves.  Of the new episodes that were published in February, how many
of them included one or more of these tracking services?  Some episodes had as many as *five* of these redirecting trackers!

*Note we can only observe "client-side" trackers. There are other podcast analytics services 
such as {{< a "https://www.tritondigital.com/solutions/audience-measurement" "Triton Digital" >}} that receive private request logs 
directly from partner hosts. Like first-party podcast host analytics, the reach of these services is not measurable in a public
way, and thus not included in this analysis.*

Analysis by [John Spurlock](https://twitter.com/johnspurlock)

Thanks to the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) for crawling every podcast, and giving us a signal of when 
to check for new episodes.

And thanks to the [Open Podcast Analytics Working Group](https://github.com/opawg) for maintaining a list of media url patterns and analytics services patterns.
We've incorporated these patterns along with some of our own to come up with the host and analytics service identification and metadata for this ranking.

*Updated 2022-03-03, with data for the month of February 2022, added AdBarker.*

*Updated 2022-02-19, added new overall breakdowns of how many new episodes use at least one tracker, and how many use at least one Spotify-owned tracker.*
