*This is an archived version, the current version is [here](/podcast-trackers-by-episode-share/).*

Now that we have a good idea of [which podcast hosts are producing new podcast episodes](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share),
let's turn our attention to third-party podcast analytics services.

These services are typically provided by a company that is not the podcast host, but can provide tracking and analytics 
by being specified as the underlying media file url, which then redirects back to the host.  Sometimes, these services
are implemented as custom prefixes (taking the original media url and adding a prefix to it), but not always.

By intercepting every episode media file request, these analytics services can provide a view that is potentially larger than
what the underlying podcast host analytics can provide.

Podtrac, one of the most popular services, released some 
[interesting data about their US download figures for September](https://podnews.net/article/podtrac-us-downloads-and-users-sep21).

But how representative of the entire podcast world is this data?  How many podcasters use services like these?

---

We already did the work of analyzing _every single new podcast episode published_ (about 2.0 million in October 2021), 
[identifying which podcast hosting company it belongs to](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share).

We used the actual media file url (past any tracking redirects) to identify the host
instead of the feed url domain, which can often undercount hosts that offer custom domains.

Let's now take a look at the tracking services themselves.  Of the new episodes that were published in October, how many
of them included one or more of these tracking services?  Some episodes had as many as *six* of these redirecting trackers!

*Note we can only observe "client-side" trackers. There are other podcast analytics services 
such as {{< a "https://www.tritondigital.com/solutions/audience-measurement" "Triton Digital" >}} that receive private request logs 
directly from partner hosts. Like first-party podcast host analytics, the reach of these services is not measurable in a public
way, and thus not included in this analysis.*

Below is the ranking of podcast analytics services ordered by new episodes published during 
the month of October 2021.

Analysis by [John Spurlock](https://twitter.com/johnspurlock)

Thanks to the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) for crawling every podcast, and giving us a signal of when 
to check for new episodes.

And thanks to the [Open Podcast Analytics Working Group](https://github.com/opawg) for maintaining a list of media url patterns and analytics services patterns.
We've incorporated these patterns along with some of our own to come up with the host and analytics service identification and metadata for this ranking.

---
*Updated 2021-11-18, added Backtracks.*

*Updated 2021-11-14, with data for the month of October 2021.*

*Updated 2021-10-21: Added Adswizz and tweaked the host identification to choose the last known host in the redirect chain instead of the first, in an attempt to better capture customer-driven host migrations.*

*Updated 2021-10-14: Added a section about how direct server-to-server analytics integrations are not publically visible, and thus out of scope.*

*Updated 2021-10-13: Removed Podtrac as a host under itself, even when it is the last media file url in the redirect chain.*
